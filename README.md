# My Personal Project

## League of Legends Rune Page Manager 

This application is for League of Legends players. League of Legends has a rune system. 
Runes add or enhance champion abilities and statistics. 
There are 5 different rune trees. 
They are: 
- Precision
- Domination
- Sorcery
- Resolve
- Inspiration

You can choose runes from 2 different trees. LoL allows you to select 4 runes from the primary tree and 2 runes from another tree which we will call the secondary tree. 
The keystone rune is the first rune from the primary tree. This rune has a major impact on your character. You can only have one keystone rune, and it must be from your primary tree.
Runes allow for varied playstyles and builds. The same character can be played in multiple different ways by changing 
your rune page. Having an application that stores your ideas for different rune pages is very useful.

The application will allow you to:
- store and keep track of rune pages 
- display all the stored rune pages
- display all the rune pages that have a specific keystone rune 
- search for a rune page using its title

This project is of interest to me as it is something that will be useful to me as I play League of Legends.
