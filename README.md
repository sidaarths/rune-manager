# My Personal Project

## League of Legends Rune Page Manager 

This application is for League of Legends players. League of Legends has a rune system. There are 5 different rune trees. 
They are: 
- Precision
- Domination
- Sorcery
- Resolve
- Inspiration

The game allows you to select 4 runes from one of the 5 trees and 2 secondary runes from another of these. 
Runes allow for varied playstyles and builds. The same character can be played in multiple different ways by changing 
your rune page. 


The application will allow you to:
- store and keep track of rune pages 
- sort through the stored rune pages
- display the rune pages that have the same specific primary tree

This project is of interest to me as it is something that will be useful to me as I play League of Legends.
